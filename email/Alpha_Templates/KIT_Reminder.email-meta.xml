We noticed that you haven’t registered your saliva sample collection kits yet. It’s simple and easy. Please go to alpha.helix.com/start and follow the instructions to register your kits and mail the two saliva samples back to us.

If you have any questions or have not received your collection kits in the mail yet, please email alpha@helix.com. Thank you for your help in launching Helix.
