Thank you again for participating in the Helix Alpha program! Your collection kits have been received at our lab in San Diego. At this time, the samples will be de-identified from your personal information and go through our sequencing process.

As a last step, we’d appreciate your feedback on how the process went. Your feedback is crucial to help us make Helix the best experience it can be.
